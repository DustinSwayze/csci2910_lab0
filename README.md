Dustin Swayze
Non-traditional student
Previously attended ETSU for Political Science
Have spent the last 10 years bartending or managing a local restaurant in town (Label)
Gained valuable knowledge in a leadership / business role, as well as soft skills and communication skills.
Developed personal and business connections to propel future careers.

In August 2022 I made the decision to go back to school to ETSU for Computer Science.
I did this to satisfy a lifelong desire to do so, as well future-proof my career and life with a better degree.

I spend most of my time studying at the moment, or spending time with my dog Hazelnut.  We like to be outside.
